# Image-Similarity-Retrieval-using-Siamese-Neural-Network-with-MobileNetV2
A deep learning project using a Siamese Network with MobileNetV2 to retrieve and rank visually similar images from the `tf_flowers` dataset. Trained on image pairs with contrastive loss and evaluated using Precision\@5, the model achieves 70â€“85% accuracy in visual similarity search.
